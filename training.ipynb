the monotonous tasks of everyday life with nothing to look forward to no aspirations whatsoever the only saving grace felt like had the only thing that made me feel like was wanted and accepted me for who am was maren as absolutely idiotic as it sounds and she is assured me that it is talking to her was the one thing looked forward to every day it was the one thing that kept me going knowing that some time throughout the day would be able to talk to her even if only briefly before we went to sleep she made me feel accepted she made me feel like had some kind of worth she made me feel like could actually like myself and be okay with who was but most of all she made me feel loved never before have ever been able to open up to someone so completely felt completely at ease when talking with her have told her things that no one else in the world knows about me and she made me feel like she actually cared about them that she cared about me we shared many intimate moments that would never dare have with anyone else we talked about getting together being with each other devising crazy scenarios with how to be together we talked all the time nothing could keep us apart except for ty she helped me through all of the problems was facing related to my depression over the breakup with starr she talked to me whenever needed her and she always made me feel better about it she was my shining star in pitchblack sky none of this is any longer though we have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how am am sure she regrets getting involved with me and do not blame her do nothing but hurt her these days none of it is intentional but it happens nonetheless when we first started talking again told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that suppose she thought was overexaggerating but was not need to have interaction in my life know it is not fair to the people around me and know that it is not what they want but cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time my thoughts are extremely selfdestructive need someone to spend time with someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts for about four months was legitimately happy that was probably the only time in my life have ever actually been legitimately happy was finally over starr thanks to the help from maren had no stress at all things were actually looking up even my migraines were becoming few and far between was in love and felt loved if could go back in time and replay those four months over and over again would without hesitation that was the best time of my life did not have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control did not have to feel like had to hold all of my feelings inside could share them with maren and she was incredibly receptive did not have to lie about who was or leave details out maren made me feel like was good person told her about my past and she seemed genuinely concerned for me she tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things have been told about myself she told me that was attractive something had never been told before not even by starr who was together with for ten years was happy with who was at that time prior to that had never willingly taken picture of myself but with her we would send each other snapchat pictures and she made me feel like was not the hideous person that thought myself to be in hindsight am sure that she was just being nice to me and that she did not actually think was attractive it was still nice to hear it though miss those days long for them to return but know that that will never happen the same thing has happened with many people before though none to that extreme they are fine with me when we first start talking and eventually they realise how highmaintenance and fucked up am that causes them to drift away until eventually we stop talking altogether or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives that was the case with starr the night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me in the morning she told me it was over and few weeks later told me to never talk to her again after ten years of being together she ended it on whim and caused me to lose not only my significant other but also my best friend the same thing is happening with maren am driving her away and eventually will not have best friend again will be completely alone the last time was completely alone right after starr broke up with me did not leave my room for two weeks did not eat single thing in those two weeks laid there in bed staring at my ceiling in the darkness constantly in tears trying to realise where had gone wrong have never cried so much in my life have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life but at that moment could not contain them any longer had absolutely nothing left for me in the world and that is how feel again right now it was complete luck that was actually able to reconnect with maren again have no idea at all how to make friends she just happened to be online on facebook when was feeling at my absolute lowest sent her message with no expectations whatsoever was prepared to either be completely ignored or told to go away that did not happen though we had wonderful conversation reminiscing about our childhood do not remember how the subject got changed to me talking about starr but told her everything and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it she stayed up with me until the morning just talking with me on facebook was in tears for most of that conversation partly because was still upset about the breakup but also because could not believe that someone actually cared especially someone had not talked to in over decade when we started to get close and revealed our feelings for one another we joked about how us reconnecting was red string of fate do not believe in fate but also do not think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment when felt like had nothing left the problem lies in the fact that will never be able to replicate that with anyone else am incredibly socially awkward cannot make new friends at all in person just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety online just have nothing to say am boring person have tried to make new friends on various subreddits rr4r rkikpals and the like have talked to few people who seemed nice but none of them developed into an actual friendship they all stopped talking to me after one session do not have anything at all to give in friendship after fighting with maren and being told that cannot keep badgering her to hang out with me when all asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching game of thrones with her new boyfriend who was her ex my selfworth is absolutely rock bottom she has made me realise that am the problem that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve she joined me in blaming starr for the dissolution of our relationship but see now that it was never her fault am just completely unlovable can never have more than one true friend believe this stems from the fact that growing up had very few friends and when tried to expand and make new friends got burned very badly every time because of this latch on to the one friend have suffocate them bother them until they cannot stand it any more and leave me have tried so hard to give her space and not ask her to hang out with me or talk to me but whenever try get extremely depressed have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else every time ask her to do something and she says no get sinking feeling mainly because in the four months that was happy we did everything together any time asked if she wanted to do something she was happy to hang out with me she was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me have very little to offer it was mainly her driving everything and that must have been exhausting am getting

years approaching 3 12 years now got prescribed zoloft and am up to 75mg now have also been attending therapy sessions with psychologist for about 6 weeks now its not working though if anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse and it feels like it is not even getting worse at slower rate over the last few years have made lot of changes to try to help went from 198 to 150 started eating healthier changed majors to something that both enjoy more and that has more career prospects transferred colleges since the first one was not working out joined few clubs and have actually made few friends even attended my first college party after 2 12 years of never being invited to anything now have finally gone to get professional help both psychologic and psychiatric and none of it has helped if anything its only gotten worse since do not even have the hope that any more changes will help the hope is gone when was kid used to get pneumonia lot had it like 5 times before was 3 wish would have just died back then could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on now have ton of other people to drag down with me the latest think would be happy if thing has been getting in relationship think am thinking this is the latest thing since its one of the only changes have not yet made and because pretty genuinely hate myself have pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my gpa do not really believe in inherent selfworth am almost 21 now and have not ever been on date let alone received nonplatonic hug nobody ever expresses interest in me always have to initiate thought have found this is usually the case with my friends as well if do not initiate would never get invited to anything cannot even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit it is not like can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since still have classes to go to it feels like all the changes have made over the years have amounted to nothing am just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time have not been able to cry in years so just self harm when feel like crying it is not the best release and it feels like it has diminishing returns since lately it does not give me the rush it used to it just makes it little easier to breath if that makes any sense besides it beats drinking heavily like most normal people my age do though admitably much prefer being drunk to not being drunk all my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers it feels like have gotten left behind on the road of life everyone is dating some are already married with people they love get pms from one of my friends from high school asking me if have started dating yet keep trying to explain to him that am trying but not having any luck whenever dating comes up that is all ever get am sure you will find someone eventually thing is none of the would might be happy if things before have obviously failed but this is the only change left can make since professional and medical help has failed do not enjoy anything anymore dota 2 and csgo feel like chores eu4 is too frustrating now have already played through all the rpgs enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through do not enjoy running or hiking as much now and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year do not have any shows really enjoy have always wanted to learn to draw am actually huge fan of furry art but am pretty bad and am perfectionist so practicing is so frustrating that pretty much cannot do it and get better suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better the logic mean with get better is that zero is still larger than negative number so would be better off used to think ok will wait until turn 30 and then will kill myself if things have not improved however as things have deteriorated have moved that up to 25 more recently have moved it up to after graduation am thinking it could be my own graduation present to myself do not even know how am going to make it that far suicide feels inevitable at this point like its something have to do do not buy the whole it gets better thing anymore its been over 3 years it really does not in my experience all the medical advice have been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself do not understand to what end though like if do not kill myself now then what get to continue hurting tomorrow the only end this seems to lead to is why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum do not see the appeal in it think once do it will go out to nice secluded part of one of my local national parks like and shoot myself in the head really late at night nobody would notice am gone possibly for few weeks nobody would hear thing might not even be found my body can feed some scavengers do not have to hurt anymore people who love me do not have to see me hurt anymore everyone wins have been dead inside for years its just taking the rest of me while to catch up of course this is still likely few years away so am probably not at immediate risk of killing myself so that is where am standing it is 3am right now and cannot sleep anymore because went to bed at 7 last night because was out of energy and feeling suicidal again the zoloft just gives me headaches makes me hungry and gives me constipation nothing has helped and do not think can get better anymore have another therapy session with my psychologist later this afternoon do not know what to do anymore or what more

to remember they are always fragmented and real real in the way that when it ends your eyes open and you are lying in bed wondering did just wake up or just fall asleep the fragments do not seem to follow timeline just clips like hazy recollection of night out remembering moments out of long series of events in these dreams have seen the events of my life tragic and wonderful play out before me sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline it took time to get used to having these dreams especially the dark ones the ones where friend or family member passes and am forced to spectate as silent observer in their final moments it was not until my teens that felt like understood what they were as stupid as it sounds clairvoyance runs in the family if you believe in that type of thing have cousins who experience the same we have talked about them shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we did not understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us 29 out of the thousands of dreams every one of which that has so far played in my synapses not one of them shows me past the age of 29 my 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away have lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now before had ever met my wife had come to decision was not going to live past the age of 27 in fact was going to end my life on my 27th birthday cannot say for certain why chose 27 partially because was an angst filled young adult who thought if was going to die young should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 except am far from famous 27 also happens to be my favorite number could not tell you why have always just been drawn to it when my 27th birthday rolled around was newlywed of 3 months to say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you the plan would concocted still toiled about in my brain that day but my plans had changed 29 it began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past certain age the limit was always twentynine there are none where am proud father watching my children go none of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who is aged so much better than over the years after 29 they just stop we fixate on negatives humans that is it is an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives am far from being master at this myself why do not see myself as older than 29 in any of these is it because that is when my story ends will my life be destined to have dash between 1987 2017 am finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board or is it something more positive does the familys clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life is it gift we are given to be shown in part the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become glimpses to show us that no matter how low and dark things are going to get you are going to make it through this maybe we are not clairvoyant odds are it is just the family disposition for schizophrenia another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics have already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics is it going to end at 29 am going to see the other side of 30 if do not is it going to be my own doing maybe am not allowed to see how my own story ends not until experience it first hand so as to not spoil the moment do not make conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation did at one point but then accepted that part myself the part that feels knows that suicide is an option cannot say go more than week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind that thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it the thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately others are turned and inspected whatif situations played out over and over how would she react what would the funeral look like how many dominos would fall if cast my own down some may topple like my own but there would be many that would wobble for ages likely never settling back down into their original position that is the hardest hurdle for me in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself my empathy for those in my life knowing or at least thinking know how my life ending would impact theirs more so if it was selfinflicted it has always been easy to hurt myself intentionally hurting others that care about though has always felt impossible know have caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact again and again so have never been able to follow through with plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning within the next two months am going to finally disregard others feelings and selfishly satisfy my own am not even sure what to call it desire or what believe to be my stories already written ending perhaps it does end but not by any doing of myself just the chaos of existence with some luck maybe just maybe 29 is not the end it is just new beginning ',\n",

twice more and it was busy both times then found another line for some local crysis centre used to work as telephone surveyer it was like someone trying to sell me long distance plan over the phone just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell special one time offer how about we send mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you actually that sounds terrible just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor cannot see me till feburary and have no friends and my parents are large part of the problem so basically am alone am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares it is all up to you she says wow what thing to say to someone with depression yes know all my lifes decisions have been made by me know that my life is either shitty or it is not based off my actions very much know that why would be depressed if did not blame myself just fucking terrible now am just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal it is like the only support they will offer is putting you in halfway house well work fulltime so that is not going to work and do not have vacation days and work nights so one of the things they do there is get you on routine and give you support classes and whatever well that is not really going to work if get up at 810pm and go to bed at noon2pm so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life actually do not mind my job actually like it there it is the one safe spot in the world is work live at home and live my parents who raised very very fat was obese by kindergarden and have been since but know it is not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems then tried to start losing the weight and almost lost it all and then it is just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house but why do not just move out well because tried to start business with my credit and it did not work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and have maxed out my credit cards paying them rentwhich they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out did not even ask them to change their habits just asked for them not to leave junk out where can see it this was responded to in way only decribe by saying have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration so now am stuck and really want to kill myself just because know they will get stuck with my debt am not even hopelessly in debt just cannot leave here but cannot live being this fat anymore because nobody will love me or even even affectionitly touch me do not even mean sex just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from female you know do not even blame them for regecting me anymore they all actually out of their way nice to me so ya whatever guess am taking some art classes and found out am very talented lol am very honest person in way that is great on camera but am fat and people do not have sympathy for fat peoplewell unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss if you just try to put them in normal life situation people inheritly react negatively because fat people are ugly think it too but ya cannot fix it know people will not accept this statement but when am on my healthy diet feel great and am not hungry because it is well balanced and not extremely low calorie but come home from work and it is just there is food and sugar everywhere and as soon get eating it want more and then do not care because think have already fucked it up for myself might as well just eat more so do not feel bad and then feel great for little while and then crash off the sugar and feel terrible feel god awful feel doing nothing in the world that will not seem like unenjoyable effort and just think about how bad feel and how much do not want to feel that way anymore and how much wish could just do something that would make me feel better so get in my car and drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and get 3 double cheeseburgers and each has 400 calories that is 1200 calories can eat in do not know 4 stop lights away from the mcdonalds and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs on top of the regular diet which is about 500 under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around then all of sudden am like 2000 calories over my needs and then that is evey day and that is like all in the last 34 hours of the day and the next day maybe just do not care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe go and get two 400 calorie energy drinks and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and eat couple more thousand calories of junk when get home and feel terrible from crash it is just meet people and fall in love with them and can see they care about me they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down get on myself but if ever try to just anything just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction know we are in art class and you say things to me that let me know you do not hate me because act like think you hate me but it is not because you hate me it is because loveyes know do not know what the word means but like to use it you and you will regect me and it is easier for me to perceive it as hate and you go out of your way to say it is not and you care that little bit and think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it is just this natural reaction and attraction no desperation there is not time to get desperate and you just say am going to play it cool and later maybe do something and then you get home and you remember am almost 300 pounds and she was just being nice and if you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she will regect you like everyone else because you have done that that same thing has happend dozens of times and you have played it out like groundhogs day where you have done every possible thing reacted everyway tried everythingincluding not trying and it has all ended the same you know the worst part lately is started going to the gym 2 years ago and am actually in pretty good shape am just really really fat lifting and flexibility and cycleeven though it is really hard being so fat and got down to am 62 220 which the lightest have been in ever even as kid always had higher body fat percentage the first time have been under 30bmi since have remember checking my weight and now in 5 months have thrown away all of it and gained 50lbs and remember how hard it was to lose and remember had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk foodmostly it was always an issue always adding few hundred calories here and there and now it is like you can sell everything you own get your debt to controlable level and move out but have to move walking distance from work because bought car when was younger and broke down and lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there 4 vechiles to work after they moved and took me with them it was mistake to move out with them but would have no car and could not take my art classes or even have access to gym because there is not one around my work where would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there so ya was looking for place in the river to jump inthin ice around some shores and am not tryhing to violate the rules it is just it seemed like good idea was just going to jump and swim to shoreif could make it and that seemed like good idea then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something do not know it seemed like the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in confrontation with someone but whatever am really tired now and just want someone do not know there is nothing know nobody can help me the things want that will make me happy cannot ask and do not have any right to ask but crying makes me tried and do not like having to hear myself crying would not be so bad if did not have to hear the whale it is like someone else it is like am hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me am just thinking wrong reacting wrong just do not interpet the world
